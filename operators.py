#Python Logical Operators
#and 	Returns True if both statements are true	                     x < 5 and  x < 10	
#or	    Returns True if one of the statements is true	                 x < 5 or x < 4	
#not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not      (x < 5 and x < 10)


#Python Identity Operators
