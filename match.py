#Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the match statement.
day = 4
match day:
  case 1:
    print("Monday")
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday")
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday")
  case 4:
    print("Thursday")
  case 5:
    print("Friday")
  case 6:
    print("Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Sunday")

#Use the underscore character _ as the last case value if you want a code block to execute when there are not other matches:
day = 4
match day:
  case 6:
    print("Today is Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Today is Sunday")
  case _:
    print("Looking forward to the Weekend")

#use the pipe character | as an or operator in the case evaluation to check for more than one value match in one case:
day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5:
    print("Today is a weekday")
  case 6 | 7:
    print("I love weekends!")


#You can add if statements in the case evaluation as an extra condition-check:
month = 5
day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 4:
    print("A weekday in April")
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 5:
    print("A weekday in May")
  case _:
    print("No match")
